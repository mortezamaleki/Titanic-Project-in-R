This repository includes my R code in Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster project from Kaggle competitions. 
Dr. Amin Ghaderi has been my mentor in this project. 
Various machine learning classification tools such as Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, Global Linear Models, and Random Forest methods have been used in this project. 
As a result, top 20% ranking was achieved for making predictions on the test data.
